Predefined standards in software development are very important because they keep things from getting messy and disorganized, and with larger more complex projects and organizations it becomes increasingly more important.

Software developers can employ ethical habits when writing code by keeping things consistent and uniform, and ensuring their code is readable for others, and themselves at a later date. Liberal use of proper annotation and comments is vital.

The files in this repository contain this README file, the main python file containing the code called for in this assignment, and the gitignore file that is essential for every repository, and is used to tell git which files to ignore when committing changes.
